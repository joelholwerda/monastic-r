Description: Under development. 
    This project will eventually involve two components: 
    1) An R package that exports statistical output to a formatted JSON file and 
    2) A Word add-in that imports the statistical output from this JSON file. 
    A graphical interface will allow the user to insert statistics into their 
    document and automatically update them when a new JSON file is imported.
